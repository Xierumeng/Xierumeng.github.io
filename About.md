# About the Comic

It's not really a comic. More like dank memes about being an engineering student at the University of Waterloo.

# About the Blog

I am starting an introductory guide to the University of Waterloo, focused on my program.

# About the Author

Xierumeng enjoys butter tarts, explosions, and SPAAACE. Contrary to popular belief, I can't think in 7 dimensions.
