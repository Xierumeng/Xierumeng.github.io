# Projects

## Space Combat Simulator

* A somewhat realistic combat simulator, similar to KSP and Children of a Dead Earth, based on mid-future speculative technologies.
* Superconductors and fusion drives are assumed to have matured and are common throughout this universe. 3D printing is ubiquitous.

## FTL Event Editor

* A user-friendly method of modding FTL Faster Than Light, specifically, editing the XML data files for its events.
* Also contains a simulation feature for debugging purposes.

## UWaterloo Schedule Exporter

* A Google Chrome extension converting the class schedule into an iCalendar format, importable into Microsoft Outlook and/or Google Calendar.
* This is mainly for personal use, but feel free to contact me and I'll update Github/make it available for free on the Chrome Web Store.

## Repository of Knowledge

* An storage of information resources for engineering students.

## Personal website

* A place to link it all together (and somewhere to store my comics).
* You're here now!
