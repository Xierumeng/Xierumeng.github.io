Top right question taken from the ECE 105 F18 Final Examination. Hopefully I answered that correctly. For the bottom centre, I got the question from [PHD Comics](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=993). For the bottom right, I would like to thank [u/swegmesterflex](https://www.reddit.com/user/swegmesterflex) for the [meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/9zkfo0/can_i_get_an_f_in_chat/).
