    <h2>1-F. The Right Fit</h2>
    <p>Note: Wait But Why, want, why UW, computer engineering at UW, comparison with other programs</p>
    <br>
    <p>This is footnote for the series on the University of Waterloo’s application process.</p>

<p>Today’s topic will be on whether UW is a good fit for a potential applicant.</p>

<p>The first question: What are your wants? I am definitely not qualified to help answer this question,
so I will refer you to the Wait But Why article “<a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2018/04/picking-career.html">How to Pick a Career (That Actually Fits You)</a>”.</p>

<p>The second question: Is going to university something you really want to do? University programs are very difficult and very academic. It is also not the only option for post-secondary studies. For example, there are colleges and the trades.</p>

<p>The third question: Is the program the right program for you? It is difficult to transfer programs once accepted. Your marks in university will have to be very high, and even then there just might not be space. Depending on how similar or different the two programs are, you might have to delay graduation by a year or more. You should do some research on the programs by visiting a university’s <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/uWaterloo-Undergraduate-Calendar-Access">undergraduate calendar</a> and faculty websites.</p>

<p>The fourth question: Why UW, and why not a different university? Generally, the university that you graduate from won’t matter to an employer. They are most interested in previous industry experience and your relevant side projects. UW provides a means to gain experience through the co-operative education program, but other universities also offer co-op programs or an internship year, such as the University of Toronto’s Professional Engineering Year (PEY). If you plan on going into academia, the co-op program may not high on the priority list.</p>

<h3 id="computer-engineering-at-uw">Computer Engineering at UW</h3>

<p>Engineering programs at UW in general do not allow students to take very many electives. The computer engineering program in particular gives students their first elective in 3A. As the program is very prescriptive, students are forced to take unfun courses such as <a href="http://www.ucalendar.uwaterloo.ca/2021/COURSE/course-ECE.html#ECE105">ECE 105</a> (Classical Mechanics AKA physics), as well as other courses they may not be interested in. However, because of this rigidity, students are guaranteed to be able to take those required courses.</p>

<p>Computer engineering is an engineering program, so if you are interested in pursuing a <a href="https://www.peo.on.ca/">P.Eng.</a> then this could allow you to do so. The program also covers computer hardware, and if you find you are more interested in electrical engineering, then it is easy to switch before the start of the 2B term.</p>

<p>Comparing with computer science (CS), CS offers more electives, allowing students to choose what they want to learn. However, space within courses is strictly enforced, which means that there is a possibility of students not being able to enroll in the their desired course(s). CS also offers a <a href="https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/MATH-Computer-Sci-Digital-Hardware-Spec">Digital Hardware Specialization</a> for those interested in computer hardware. I speculate that CS courses are more math- and theory-based, as CS is in the faculty of mathematics.</p>

<p>Personally, when I was in grade 12, I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do, although I knew that I liked working with computers. I chose computer engineering over computer science because I didn’t think I would enjoy the math and theory too much, and since I wasn’t sure what to do, so having courses prescribed to me sounded safe. Also, I thought engineering was applicable across a large variety of fields, so getting employed would be easier. Plus, students in engineering programs get <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering/current-undergraduate-students/iron-ring">shinies</a>.</p>

<p>In terms of employment in the software industry, it does not matter to an employer whether your degree is in computer engineering, software engineering, or computer science. They are more interested in your relevant experience (e.g. previous employment in the industry, volunteer work, etc.) and relevant side projects and extracurriculars.</p>

<p>Here are some resources comparing and contrasting computer engineering, computer science, and software engineering:</p>
