    <h2>2-1. Housing and Residence</h2>
    <p>Note: Housing, residence, meal plan, living, landlord, roommate.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This is part of a 3-part series on preparation for first year at the University of Waterloo. In this series, I will cover student housing, courses, and other administrative tasks. In this series, I will refer to the incoming student as “you”.</p>

<p>Today’s topic will be on student housing. After accepting and satisfying UW’s conditional offer of admission, you will need some place to live. I will discuss two options: on-campus and off-campus, and the advantages and disadvantages of both.</p>

<p>On-campus <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/housing/">residence</a> requires a $500 deposit, which will be deducted from the final residence fee.You will have the chance to rank your choice of residence, and mention roommates you would like to room with. UW charges 4 months upfront.</p>

<p>The advantages of residence are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A guaranteed place to stay.</li>
  <li>It is relatively close to campus.</li>
  <li>It is housing with other first years, so it is easy to make friends/study groups.</li>
  <li>Parts of the residence that are not student rooms are kept clean by staff.</li>
  <li>It is close to a cafeteria in case you do not want to cook.</li>
</ul>

<p>The disadvantages of residence are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It is expensive, costing over $800 per month.</li>
  <li>An additional expensive meal plan may be required in some residences.</li>
</ul>

<p>Off-campus housing can be found through sites such as Facebook groups and Kijiji. However, demand for housing is very high in the Fall term, and so 4-month sublets will be very expensive and disappear immediately. One-year leases are easier to sign during the Fall term. Make sure to know the tenant’s legal rights. The UW subreddit has a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/wiki/index#wiki_off-campus_housing">guide</a> to off-campus housing. However, it is a bit out of date.</p>

<p>The advantages are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It might be less expensive depending on location and amenities.</li>
  <li>You have more flexibility depending on need as there are many places to choose from. For example, bedroom size, ensuite bathroom, kitchen and common area, etc.</li>
  <li>There are less restrictions than residence.</li>
</ul>

<p>The disadvantages are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You have to search through postings.</li>
  <li>It is further from campus.</li>
  <li>There may not be other first years to interact with.</li>
  <li>It is possible to have bad management. For example, illegal deposits, unaddressed maintenance problems.</li>
  <li>You will have to spend time cooking, cleaning, and grocery shopping.</li>
</ul>

<p>As usual, for both on-campus and off-campus, you will most likely have to deal with roommates, and there is a possibility of getting bad ones. Clear communication is an important factor in maintaining house harmony.</p>

<p>The important information to take away is that there are advantages and disadvantages to both on-campus and off-campus housing. You must decide which of the advantages and disadvantages are more important, and find, if not ideal, an acceptable location to live. However, student housing is not the only part of first year preparation. I will discuss those next topics in the next 2 posts.</p>
