    <h2>2-F. Summer Before Start</h2>
    <p>Note: Relax, project, work/volunteer, study ahead, independence</p>
    <br>
    <p>This is footnote for the series on preparation for first year at the University of Waterloo.</p>

<p>Today’s topic will be on what to do during the summer before entering UW.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There’s a hundred and four days of summer vacation and school comes along just to end it! So the annual problem for our generation is finding a good way to spend it! - Phineas and Ferb theme song</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first suggestion: Have fun! This is the last bit of free time you will have before getting crushed under the heel of academic and professional work. You will either be doing 60-hour weeks studying or doing 40-hour weeks on your co-op, working.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Schedule_1B.png" alt="1B Schedule" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>The second suggestion: Work on a relevant side project. Employers aren’t interested in high school assignments, nor will they be interested in university course assignments. The project could be an extension of an assignment, a clone of something that’s already been built, or an original started entirely from scratch. As long as you show that you were the one to implement it, and understand some additional concepts relevant to your industry, it will be something useful to add to your resume. Smaller, completed projects are better than larger, incomplete projects.</p>

<p>The third suggestion: Get relevant job experience. You can work or volunteer in your industry, which gives valuable experience for your resume. The money is not a bad thing either.</p>

<p>The fourth suggestion: Study ahead. Academics are hard. Even if you don’t understand the content, it’s good to know at a high level what the topic is about. I do not suggest going out of your way to buy textbooks though.</p>

<p>The fifth suggestion: Learn to become independent. At university, you will be on your own. Do you know how to do laundry? To interact with other humans? To cook? Clean? Sew (well, that’s less important)? If your laptop breaks, can you do basic troubleshooting? Grocery shopping? Budgeting? Time management? Deal with housing management? Make a doctor’s appointment (or any other appointment)? The list goes on.</p>

<p>The important information to take away is to think about what you want to do during the summer before entering UW. Note that none of my five suggestions are mutually exclusive, nor is it exhaustive.</p>
