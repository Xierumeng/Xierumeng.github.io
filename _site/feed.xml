        <title>1-F. The Right Fit</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is footnote for the series on the University of Waterloo’s application process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s topic will be on whether UW is a good fit for a potential applicant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first question: What are your wants?
I am definitely not qualified to help answer this question,
so I will refer you to the Wait But Why article “&lt;a href=&quot;https://waitbutwhy.com/2018/04/picking-career.html&quot;&gt;How to Pick a Career (That Actually Fits You)&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second question: Is going to university something you really want to do?
University programs are very difficult and very academic. It is also not the only option for post-secondary studies.
For example, there are colleges and the trades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third question: Is the program the right program for you? It is difficult to transfer programs once accepted.
Your marks in university will have to be very high, and even then there just might not be space.
Depending on how similar or different the two programs are, you might have to delay graduation by a year or more.
You should do some research on the programs by visiting a university’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/uWaterloo-Undergraduate-Calendar-Access&quot;&gt;undergraduate calendar&lt;/a&gt; and faculty websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth question: Why UW, and why not a different university?
Generally, the university that you graduate from won’t matter to an employer.
They are most interested in previous industry experience and your relevant side projects.
UW provides a means to gain experience through the co-operative education program,
but other universities also offer co-op programs or an internship year, such as the University of Toronto’s (UofT) Professional Engineering Year (PEY).
If you plan on going into academia, the co-op program may not high on the priority list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;computer-engineering-at-uw&quot;&gt;Computer Engineering at UW&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engineering programs at UW in general do not allow students to take very many electives.
The computer engineering program in particular gives students their first elective in 3A.
As the program is very prescriptive, students are forced to take unfun courses such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucalendar.uwaterloo.ca/2021/COURSE/course-ECE.html#ECE105&quot;&gt;ECE 105&lt;/a&gt;
(Classical Mechanics AKA physics), as well as other courses they may not be interested in.
However, because of this rigidity, students are guaranteed to be able to take those required courses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computer engineering is an engineering program,
so if you are interested in pursuing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.peo.on.ca/&quot;&gt;P.Eng.&lt;/a&gt; then this could allow you to do so.
The program also covers computer hardware, and if you find you are more interested in electrical engineering,
then it is easy to switch before the start of the 2B term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparing with computer science (CS), CS offers more electives, allowing students to choose what they want to learn.
However, space within courses is strictly enforced, which means that there is a possibility of students not being able to enroll in the their desired course(s).
CS also offers a &lt;a href=&quot;https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/MATH-Computer-Sci-Digital-Hardware-Spec&quot;&gt;Digital Hardware Specialization&lt;/a&gt;
for those interested in computer hardware. I speculate that CS courses are more math- and theory-based, as CS is in the faculty of mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, when I was in grade 12, I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do, although I knew that I liked working with computers.
I chose computer engineering over computer science because I didn’t think I would enjoy the math and theory too much,
and since I wasn’t sure what to do, so having courses prescribed to me sounded safe.
Also, I thought engineering was applicable across a large variety of fields, so getting employed would be easier.
Plus, students in engineering programs get &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering/current-undergraduate-students/iron-ring&quot;&gt;shinies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of employment in the software industry, it does not matter to an employer whether your degree is in computer engineering, software engineering, or computer science. They are more interested in your relevant experience (e.g. previous employment in the industry, volunteer work, etc.) and relevant side projects and extracurriculars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some resources comparing and contrasting computer engineering, computer science, and software engineering:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>1-3. Video Interview</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is part of a 3-part series on the University of Waterloo’s application process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s topic will be on the video interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this interview is not a requirement for the application process,
consider it mandatory as the applicant who does not do the interview will likely be passed over for an applicant who has.
The video interview is hosted by Kira Talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video interview consists of a few short questions the applicant will have to answer immediately,
within a very limited timeframe (one to two minutes).
Kira Talent does provide some practice questions, so the applicant can answer these and review their recorded responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest that the applicant prepare for this interview in the same way one would prepare for a job interview,
by creating some responses to common interview questions and practicing them with another person.
There will also be questions where the applicant has not prepared an answer, so being able to think quickly and on the spot is an asset.
Also make sure to use good presentation skills: for example, avoid filler sounds such as “um” or “ah”.
I also suggest the applicant dress reasonably well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The applicant should have a stable internet connection during the interview process.
A short video will play where a representative from UW will ask the question before Kira Talent begins recording the response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important information to take away from this video is to treat the video interview as a real job interview,
with preparation beforehand and the ability to adapt, improvise, and overcome in unexpected cases.
This concludes the main parts of this 3-part series on the University of Waterloo’s application process,
covering high school course marks, the admission information form, and the video interview.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>1-2. Admission Information Form</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is part of a 3-part series on the University of Waterloo’s application process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s topic will be on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/admissions/admission-information-form&quot;&gt;admission information form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This form is mandatory to be considered in the engineering admissions process, and there is a hard submission deadline.
Miss the deadline, and you will be rejected unless you appeal with a very good reason.
You are expected to create an account in &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/&quot;&gt;Quest&lt;/a&gt;, where the form and other administrative information are located.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The form consists of several sections.
In some parts, you will answer short questions, limited to several hundred characters.
In other parts, you will fill out extracurricular activities, previous or current employment, courses, skills, and other requested information.
You will also indicate your second engineering choice in case you do not get into your first.
Please note that you are &lt;a href=&quot;https://profbillanderson.com/2013/01/02/computer-engineering-or-software-engineering/#comment-227&quot;&gt;not penalized&lt;/a&gt;
when being considered for your second choice if you don’t get your first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a good AIF, good extracurricular activities and employment are important.
What the admissions team is looking for, I have no clue.
I speculate that activities requiring soft skills such as leadership, teamwork, and organization are particularly valuable,
as well as activities requiring creativity and perseverance.
I also speculate that activities related to the program of choice will be helpful for the AIF.
It is also important to participate in the various contests hosted by UW, such as the Canadian Computing Competition (CCC) and Euclid Mathematics Contest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The university is looking for students that will not only survive, but actually thrive in its environment.
See Angela Duckworth’s website on &lt;a href=&quot;http://angeladuckworth.com/grit-scale/&quot;&gt;grit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AIF is like a resume and cover letter; it is a mechanism which allows you to distinguish yourself from their peers and to show why UW would be a good fit for them.
The AIF also allows the applicant to explain circumstances that may have affected their academic performance.
The AIF is &lt;a href=&quot;https://profbillanderson.com/2014/01/04/scoring-your-aif/&quot;&gt;marked out of 5 points&lt;/a&gt;.
Generally, most AIFs will be marked as 3 for an average applicant with average extracurriculars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have filled out the AIF, it must be saved or submitted, otherwise, all work will be lost.
I suggest writing responses on another document before copy-pasting it into the form.
This information also useful for other purposes not related to the AIF, such as your resume and/or applications to other university programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important information to take away is to participate in extracurricular activities and contests hosted by the University of Waterloo in order to increase the AIF mark,
therefore increasing the chance of being accepted into the program of choice.
However, high school marks and the AIF are not the only factor in determining chances of being accepted.
I will discuss the next topic in the next post.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>1-1. High School Marks</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a 3-part series on the University of Waterloo’s application process.
In this series, I cover high school course marks, the admission information form (AIF), and the video interview.
In this series, I will refer to the applicant as “you”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s topic will be on high school marks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I attended high school in Ontario, so I will focus on the Undergrad (101) process.
The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ouac.on.ca/&quot;&gt;Ontario Universities’ Application Centre&lt;/a&gt; (OUAC) is also where to submit the three (or more) applications to various university programs.
UW only accepts one application to an engineering program, but you will also get a chance to choose a second choice in the AIF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ontario high schools will send grade 11 and first semester grade 12 marks to the OUAC.
As second semester progresses, high schools will update the OUAC with second semester grade 12 midterm marks.
Universities will take the first batch and/or the second batch to use for their admissions process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grade 11 marks are generally only useful for early admission.
What’s more important is to maintain high marks in the first semester of grade 12 and in the first part of second semester,
as those are what the universities will focus on.
Even though my marks in grade 11 were not very good, I focused on my studies in grade 12 and managed to get accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. William Bishop is the Director of Admissions for the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Waterloo,
and maintains a blog on engineering admissions, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theroadtoengineering.com/&quot;&gt;The Road to Engineering&lt;/a&gt;.
In this blog, he writes about the admissions process, and gives useful insights on how the admissions team gives offers to applicants.
There are nice graphs displaying the chance of admission given an average mark.
Also check out Dr. William Anderson’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://profbillanderson.com/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; for information on previous years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grade inflation has become a problem in the past few years,
and so there exists an &lt;a href=&quot;https://globalnews.ca/news/4405495/waterloo-engineering-grade-inflation-list/&quot;&gt;adjustment factor&lt;/a&gt;,
depending on the high school.
On average, this adjustment factor is 16%. How this adjustment factor affects admissions, I have no clue.
However, I can speculate that having a lower adjustment factor is better.
I believe the Faculty of Mathematics does not include an adjustment factor in their admissions process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A conditional offer of acceptance will be sent out to the lucky ~10% in May (or earlier, depending on the round).
You will be expected to maintain their second semester grade 12 average above a certain threshold, typically 80 to 85%.
Once this condition is met, you will be fully accepted into the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important information to take away is to maintain high grade 12 marks in order to increase the chances of being accepted into the program of choice.
However, marks are not the only factor in determining chances of being accepted. I will discuss those next topics in the next 2 posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Top right question taken from the ECE 105 F18 Final Examination. Hopefully I answered that correctly. For the bottom centre, I got the question from &lt;a href=&quot;http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=993&quot;&gt;PHD Comics&lt;/a&gt;. For the bottom right, I would like to thank &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/swegmesterflex&quot;&gt;u/swegmesterflex&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/9zkfo0/can_i_get_an_f_in_chat/&quot;&gt;meme&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
