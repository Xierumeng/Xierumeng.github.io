        <title>2-F. Summer Before Start</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is footnote for the series on preparation for first year at the University of Waterloo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s topic will be on what to do during the summer before entering UW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There’s a hundred and four days of summer vacation and school comes along just to end it! So the annual problem for our generation is finding a good way to spend it! - Phineas and Ferb theme song&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first suggestion: Have fun! This is the last bit of free time you will have before getting crushed under the heel of academic and professional work. You will either be doing 60-hour weeks studying or doing 40-hour weeks on your co-op, working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Schedule_1B.png&quot; alt=&quot;1B Schedule&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second suggestion: Work on a relevant side project. Employers aren’t interested in high school assignments, nor will they be interested in university course assignments. The project could be an extension of an assignment, a clone of something that’s already been built, or an original started entirely from scratch. As long as you show that you were the one to implement it, and understand some additional concepts relevant to your industry, it will be something useful to add to your resume. Smaller, completed projects are better than larger, incomplete projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third suggestion: Get relevant job experience. You can work or volunteer in your industry, which gives valuable experience for your resume. The money is not a bad thing either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth suggestion: Study ahead. Academics are hard. Even if you don’t understand the content, it’s good to know at a high level what the topic is about. I do not suggest going out of your way to buy textbooks though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fifth suggestion: Learn to become independent. At university, you will be on your own. Do you know how to do laundry? To interact with other humans? To cook? Clean? Sew (well, that’s less important)? If your laptop breaks, can you do basic troubleshooting? Grocery shopping? Budgeting? Time management? Deal with housing management? Make a doctor’s appointment (or any other appointment)? The list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important information to take away is to think about what you want to do during the summer before entering UW. Note that none of my five suggestions are mutually exclusive, nor is it exhaustive.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>2-3. Administrivia</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is part of a 3-part series on preparation for first year at the University of Waterloo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s topic will be on other administrative tasks. I will talk about fees, email, the UW campus, and streams (also known as study/work sequences).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UW fees include mandatory fees, such as tuition and co-op, as well as optional fees, such as student societies. The exact amount you must pay can be found in Quest, and can be paid through a financial institution. I suggest that you at least also support your student society, for example the Engineering Society for engineers, as they have many useful resources such as resume critiques and exam banks. WEEF is also a good organization support as they maintain lab equipment and TAs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must also set up your email, as it is the primary means of communication with the university, either with the Registrar, academic advisors, or professors. How exactly to set up this email, I have no clue. I did it once and never did it again. Google is your friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the important buildings on the UW campus are either inside the ring road or just outside of it. Online maps such as Google maps and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uwaterloo.ca/map/&quot;&gt;UW’s online map&lt;/a&gt; can help you navigate through these Geese-infested lands. The app &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/luckytoilet/watisrain&quot;&gt;WatIsRain&lt;/a&gt; is also useful if you want to spend even less time outdoors by allowing you to take the various indoor building connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering/future-undergraduate-students/co-op-experience/co-op-studywork-sequences&quot;&gt;stream or sequence&lt;/a&gt; determines which terms you will be on an academic study term or co-op work term. The stream 8 sequence starts with consecutive study terms, 1A and 1B, and then alternates between study and work terms until 4B. The stream 4F sequence starts with alternating study and work terms until 3A, when the 3B study term follows immediately after to sync with the rest of the program. There are slight differences in the stream 4 sequences, so make sure to check the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/Study-Work-Sequence&quot;&gt;undergraduate calendar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sequence in which you are placed is usually random. I speculate there is probably a 1/3 chance of being placed in stream 8 and a 2/3 chance of being placed in stream 4 for computer engineering, based on the 3 sections (1 in stream 8 and 2 in stream 4). It is possible to request a specific stream by contacting the university. How exactly, I have no clue. For those entering in 2018, 2019, and 2020, it was by emailing a specific email address. After you are placed in a stream, it is difficult to switch as many other students are also trying to do the same. Generally, it is easier to switch into stream 4 than it is to switch into stream 8. When streams are assigned you can find yours on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eng.uwaterloo.ca/StreamLookup.php&quot;&gt;stream lookup page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opinion: An upper year summarized the two streams:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;S4 - Easier to get first co-op, more school summer terms, doesn’t compete with SEs in the same year, two sections (more people)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;S8 - More time to settle into university, 2 co-ops in third year instead of 2 in first year, more summer co-op terms, tends to have less competition with upper year ECEs and SEs, one section (less people)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I heavily recommend stream 8. I’m struggling to think of any significant pros for stream 4.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am in stream 4. Would I have done better in stream 8? I have no clue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important information to take away is to pay UW fees on time, to be able to access student emails, know how to navigate campus to get to classes, and know which stream to follow to be able to plan out courses and housing. This concludes the main parts of this 3-part series on preparation for first year at the University of Waterloo, covering student housing, courses, and other administrative tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>2-2. Course Selection</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is part of a 3-part series on preparation for first year at the University of Waterloo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s topic will be on courses. After accepting and satisfying UW’s conditional offer of admission, you will need select courses. I will discuss course selection in general. If you need advice on which courses to pick, you can see your program requirements on the undergraduate calendar, or ask an academic advisor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must choose courses for the upcoming academic term (unless their life is already planned out, such as in engineering). This is done through &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/&quot;&gt;Quest&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/registering-courses/course-selection-period&quot;&gt;Course Selection Period&lt;/a&gt;, students essentially add their desired courses to a shopping cart, in descending priority. I suggest that you prioritize program requirements over electives. Once the course selection period ends, the registrar attempts to make a conflict-free schedule for all of the students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have missed the course selection period, or would like to change your mind after this period, you may do so during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwaterloo.ca/registrar/registering-courses/dropadd-period&quot;&gt;Drop/Add period&lt;/a&gt;. This period, unlike the first, is first-come-first-serve. Even if you would like to add the course, there is a possibility they might not be able to due to space or time constraints. If this occurs, you may be able to ask an academic advisor for an override, although this is not guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Class schedules and term availability are accessible through UW’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infocour/CIR/SA/under.html&quot;&gt;administrative systems&lt;/a&gt;. The undergraduate calendar is also a good resource. There are also other sites such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwflow.com/&quot;&gt;UW Flow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/cscf/teaching/schedule/&quot;&gt;Odyssey&lt;/a&gt; which format the course’s schedule and availability in a slightly nicer way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some courses are only offered on specific terms. You will need to plan their courses ahead of time, including pre-requisites, so that you will be able to complete their degree on time and/or if you want to take specific electives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important information to take away is that you are able to select courses through Quest during the two periods. You may also contact an academic advisor for advice or for course overrides. Some courses are only available on certain terms. However, courses are not the only part of first year preparation. I will discuss the next topic in the next post.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>2-1. Housing and Residence</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is part of a 3-part series on preparation for first year at the University of Waterloo. In this series, I will cover student housing, courses, and other administrative tasks. In this series, I will refer to the incoming student as “you”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s topic will be on student housing. After accepting and satisfying UW’s conditional offer of admission, you will need some place to live. I will discuss two options: on-campus and off-campus, and the advantages and disadvantages of both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On-campus &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwaterloo.ca/housing/&quot;&gt;residence&lt;/a&gt; requires a $500 deposit, which will be deducted from the final residence fee.You will have the chance to rank your choice of residence, and mention roommates you would like to room with. UW charges 4 months upfront.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantages of residence are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A guaranteed place to stay.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is relatively close to campus.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is housing with other first years, so it is easy to make friends/study groups.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Parts of the residence that are not student rooms are kept clean by staff.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is close to a cafeteria in case you do not want to cook.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disadvantages of residence are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is expensive, costing over $800 per month.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An additional expensive meal plan may be required in some residences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Off-campus housing can be found through sites such as Facebook groups and Kijiji. However, demand for housing is very high in the Fall term, and so 4-month sublets will be very expensive and disappear immediately. One-year leases are easier to sign during the Fall term. Make sure to know the tenant’s legal rights. The UW subreddit has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/wiki/index#wiki_off-campus_housing&quot;&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt; to off-campus housing. However, it is a bit out of date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantages are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It might be less expensive depending on location and amenities.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You have more flexibility depending on need as there are many places to choose from. For example, bedroom size, ensuite bathroom, kitchen and common area, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are less restrictions than residence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disadvantages are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You have to search through postings.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is further from campus.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There may not be other first years to interact with.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is possible to have bad management. For example, illegal deposits, unaddressed maintenance problems.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You will have to spend time cooking, cleaning, and grocery shopping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, for both on-campus and off-campus, you will most likely have to deal with roommates, and there is a possibility of getting bad ones. Clear communication is an important factor in maintaining house harmony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important information to take away is that there are advantages and disadvantages to both on-campus and off-campus housing. You must decide which of the advantages and disadvantages are more important, and find, if not ideal, an acceptable location to live. However, student housing is not the only part of first year preparation. I will discuss those next topics in the next 2 posts.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>1-F. The Right Fit</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is footnote for the series on the University of Waterloo’s application process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s topic will be on whether UW is a good fit for a potential applicant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first question: What are your wants? I am definitely not qualified to help answer this question,
so I will refer you to the Wait But Why article “&lt;a href=&quot;https://waitbutwhy.com/2018/04/picking-career.html&quot;&gt;How to Pick a Career (That Actually Fits You)&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second question: Is going to university something you really want to do? University programs are very difficult and very academic. It is also not the only option for post-secondary studies. For example, there are colleges and the trades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third question: Is the program the right program for you? It is difficult to transfer programs once accepted. Your marks in university will have to be very high, and even then there just might not be space. Depending on how similar or different the two programs are, you might have to delay graduation by a year or more. You should do some research on the programs by visiting a university’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/uWaterloo-Undergraduate-Calendar-Access&quot;&gt;undergraduate calendar&lt;/a&gt; and faculty websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth question: Why UW, and why not a different university? Generally, the university that you graduate from won’t matter to an employer. They are most interested in previous industry experience and your relevant side projects. UW provides a means to gain experience through the co-operative education program, but other universities also offer co-op programs or an internship year, such as the University of Toronto’s Professional Engineering Year (PEY). If you plan on going into academia, the co-op program may not high on the priority list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;computer-engineering-at-uw&quot;&gt;Computer Engineering at UW&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engineering programs at UW in general do not allow students to take very many electives. The computer engineering program in particular gives students their first elective in 3A. As the program is very prescriptive, students are forced to take unfun courses such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucalendar.uwaterloo.ca/2021/COURSE/course-ECE.html#ECE105&quot;&gt;ECE 105&lt;/a&gt; (Classical Mechanics AKA physics), as well as other courses they may not be interested in. However, because of this rigidity, students are guaranteed to be able to take those required courses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computer engineering is an engineering program, so if you are interested in pursuing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.peo.on.ca/&quot;&gt;P.Eng.&lt;/a&gt; then this could allow you to do so. The program also covers computer hardware, and if you find you are more interested in electrical engineering, then it is easy to switch before the start of the 2B term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparing with computer science (CS), CS offers more electives, allowing students to choose what they want to learn. However, space within courses is strictly enforced, which means that there is a possibility of students not being able to enroll in the their desired course(s). CS also offers a &lt;a href=&quot;https://ugradcalendar.uwaterloo.ca/page/MATH-Computer-Sci-Digital-Hardware-Spec&quot;&gt;Digital Hardware Specialization&lt;/a&gt; for those interested in computer hardware. I speculate that CS courses are more math- and theory-based, as CS is in the faculty of mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, when I was in grade 12, I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do, although I knew that I liked working with computers. I chose computer engineering over computer science because I didn’t think I would enjoy the math and theory too much, and since I wasn’t sure what to do, so having courses prescribed to me sounded safe. Also, I thought engineering was applicable across a large variety of fields, so getting employed would be easier. Plus, students in engineering programs get &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering/current-undergraduate-students/iron-ring&quot;&gt;shinies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of employment in the software industry, it does not matter to an employer whether your degree is in computer engineering, software engineering, or computer science. They are more interested in your relevant experience (e.g. previous employment in the industry, volunteer work, etc.) and relevant side projects and extracurriculars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some resources comparing and contrasting computer engineering, computer science, and software engineering:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>1-3. Video Interview</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is part of a 3-part series on the University of Waterloo’s application process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s topic will be on the video interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this interview is not a requirement for the application process, consider it mandatory as the applicant who does not do the interview will likely be passed over for an applicant who has. The video interview is hosted by Kira Talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video interview consists of a few short questions you will have to answer immediately, within a very limited timeframe (one to two minutes). Kira Talent does provide some practice questions, so you can answer these and review their recorded responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest that you prepare for this interview in the same way you would prepare for a job interview, by creating some responses to common interview questions and practicing them with another person. There will also be questions where you have not prepared an answer, so being able to think quickly and on the spot is an asset. Also make sure to use good presentation skills: for example, avoid filler sounds such as “um” or “ah”. I also suggest you dress reasonably well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should have a stable internet connection during the interview process. A short video will play where a representative from UW will ask the question before Kira Talent begins recording the response. If something goes wrong, you can contact Kira Talent for help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important information to take away from this video is to treat the video interview as a real job interview, with preparation beforehand and the ability to adapt, improvise, and overcome in unexpected cases. This concludes the main parts of this 3-part series on the University of Waterloo’s application process, covering high school course marks, the admission information form, and the video interview.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>1-2. Admission Information Form</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is part of a 3-part series on the University of Waterloo’s application process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s topic will be on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwaterloo.ca/future-students/admissions/admission-information-form&quot;&gt;admission information form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This form is mandatory to be considered in the engineering admissions process, and there is a hard submission deadline. Miss the deadline, and you will be rejected unless you appeal with a very good reason. You are expected to create an account in &lt;a href=&quot;https://uwaterloo.ca/quest/&quot;&gt;Quest&lt;/a&gt;, where the form and other administrative information are located.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The form consists of several sections. In some parts, you will answer short questions, limited to several hundred characters. In other parts, you will fill out extracurricular activities, previous or current employment, courses, skills, and other requested information. You will also indicate your second engineering choice in case you do not get into your first. Please note that you are &lt;a href=&quot;https://profbillanderson.com/2013/01/02/computer-engineering-or-software-engineering/#comment-227&quot;&gt;not penalized&lt;/a&gt; when being considered for your second choice if you don’t get your first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a good AIF, good extracurricular activities and employment are important. What the admissions team is looking for, I have no clue. I speculate that activities requiring soft skills such as leadership, teamwork, and organization are particularly valuable, as well as activities requiring creativity and perseverance. I also speculate that activities related to the program of choice will be helpful for the AIF. It is also important to participate in the various contests hosted by UW, such as the Canadian Computing Competition (CCC) and Euclid Mathematics Contest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The university is looking for students that will not only survive, but actually thrive in its environment. See Angela Duckworth’s website on &lt;a href=&quot;http://angeladuckworth.com/grit-scale/&quot;&gt;grit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AIF is like a resume and cover letter; it is a mechanism which allows you to distinguish yourself from their peers and to show why UW would be a good fit for them. The AIF also allows the applicant to explain circumstances that may have affected their academic performance. The AIF is &lt;a href=&quot;https://profbillanderson.com/2014/01/04/scoring-your-aif/&quot;&gt;marked out of 5 points&lt;/a&gt;. Generally, most AIFs will be marked as 3 for an average applicant with average extracurriculars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have filled out the AIF, it must be saved or submitted, otherwise, all work will be lost. I suggest writing responses on another document before copy-pasting it into the form. This information also useful for other purposes not related to the AIF, such as your resume and/or applications to other university programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important information to take away is to participate in extracurricular activities and contests hosted by the University of Waterloo in order to increase the AIF mark, therefore increasing the chance of being accepted into the program of choice. However, high school marks and the AIF are not the only factor in determining chances of being accepted. I will discuss the next topic in the next post.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>1-1. High School Marks</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is part of a 3-part series on the University of Waterloo’s application process. In this series, I cover high school course marks, the admission information form (AIF), and the video interview. In this series, I will refer to the applicant as “you”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s topic will be on high school marks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I attended high school in Ontario, so I will focus on the Undergrad (101) process. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ouac.on.ca/&quot;&gt;Ontario Universities’ Application Centre&lt;/a&gt; (OUAC) is also where to submit the three (or more) applications to various university programs. UW only accepts one application to an engineering program, but you will also get a chance to choose a second choice in the AIF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ontario high schools will send grade 11 and first semester grade 12 marks to the OUAC. As second semester progresses, high schools will update the OUAC with second semester grade 12 midterm marks. Universities will take the first batch and/or the second batch to use for their admissions process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grade 11 marks are generally only useful for early admission. What’s more important is to maintain high marks in the first semester of grade 12 and in the first part of second semester, as those are what the universities will focus on. Even though my marks in grade 11 were not very good, I focused on my studies in grade 12 and managed to get accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. William Bishop is the Director of Admissions for the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Waterloo, and maintains a blog on engineering admissions, &lt;a href=&quot;https://theroadtoengineering.com/&quot;&gt;The Road to Engineering&lt;/a&gt;. In this blog, he writes about the admissions process, and gives useful insights on how the admissions team gives offers to applicants. There are nice graphs displaying the chance of admission given an average mark. Also check out Dr. William Anderson’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://profbillanderson.com/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; for information on previous years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grade inflation has become a problem in the past few years, and so there exists an &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aj9k8iaBgWYREcT6vtiKAFV8X8aTYtN7fdxHlLbSioA/htmlview#&quot;&gt;adjustment factor&lt;/a&gt;, depending on the high school. On average, this adjustment factor is 16%. How this adjustment factor affects admissions, I have no clue. However, I can speculate that having a lower adjustment factor is better. I believe the Faculty of Mathematics does not include an adjustment factor in their admissions process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A conditional offer of acceptance will be sent out to the lucky ~10% in May (or earlier, depending on the round). You will be expected to maintain their second semester grade 12 average above a certain threshold, typically 80% to 85%. Once this condition is met, you will be fully accepted into the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important information to take away is to maintain high grade 12 marks in order to increase the chances of being accepted into the program of choice. However, marks are not the only factor in determining chances of being accepted. I will discuss those next topics in the next 2 posts.&lt;/p&gt;
