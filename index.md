# Welcome, fellow humans.

This is my personal website, a hub to all of my other projects and a place to host my comics and blog. My formal website is elsewhere.

Navigation bar is fixed, but just in case there are links below and the header leads back here to the front page. Also, I apologize if images are acting up; I also don't really know how to scale them nicely. If there are any other issues, feel free to open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Xierumeng/Xierumeng.github.io).

I hope you enjoy my content!

Sincerely,

Xierumeng

P.S. Check out my [Patreon]({{ site.author_patreon_username }})!
