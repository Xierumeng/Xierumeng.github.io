# Welcome, fellow humans.

This is my personal website, a hub to all of my other projects and a place to host my comics and blog. My formal website is elsewhere.

I apologize in advance if this website is broken or something. I'm just starting to learn how to do this. Also, I apologize if images are acting up; I also don't really know how to scale them nicely. Feel free to open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/Xierumeng/Xierumeng.github.io).

I hope you enjoy my content!

Sincerely,

Xierumeng

P.S. Check out my [Patreon]({{ site.author_patreon_username }})!
