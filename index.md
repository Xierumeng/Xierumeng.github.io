# Welcome, fellow humans.

This is my website, a hub to all of my other projects and a place to host my comics.

* [PROJECTS]({{ site.url }}/projects) - Link and description of various projects I'm currently working on.
* [FIRST PAGE]({{ site.url }}/001) - First page of my comics.
* [LAST PAGE]({{ site.url }}/005) - Last page of my comics.
* [ARCHIVE]({{ site.url }}/archive) - A list of all of my comics.
* [ABOUT]({{ site.url }}/about) - Some information about myself.
* [EXTRAS]({{ site.url }}/extras) - Miscellaneous stuff.

I apologize in advance if this website is broken or something. I'm just starting to learn how to do this.
Also, I apologize if images are acting up; I also don't really know how to scale them nicely.
Feel free to open an issue on [Github](https://github.com/Xierumeng/Xierumeng.github.io).

Note: The navigation bar is broken on mobile. I will get to this when I have the time.

I hope you enjoy my content!

Sincerely,

Xierumeng
